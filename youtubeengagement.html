<h2>Introduction</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>YouTube is a great place to promote your business, but it can also be a great place to build an audience. Creating engaging content that keeps users engaged is key if you want to keep them coming back for more and this means keeping up with trends in online video and finding new ways of using the platform that will keep people excited about what you have to offer.</p>

<h2>Video quality</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you might have expected, the quality of your video is important. A poor-quality camera and microphone will result in a blurry or fuzzy video that no one will want to watch. If you're using a phone, don't use the built-in camera that's just not good enough! Instead, get an external camera for better picture quality and audio capture.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You also want to make sure that your lighting is good; if someone can't see what they're filming properly because it's too dark or bright (you'll lose focus), then there won't be any attention grabbed by what they're seeing onscreen! Using a tripod will help with this issue as well since it allows everything else around them remain steady while they film themselves talking this gives people something interesting enough so they don't focus elsewhere instead."</p>

<h2>Video length</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to video length, you need to keep in mind what type of content you're creating.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Short videos are good for information and entertainment, so long as they don't drag out too far into the boring or irrelevant territory (like a lecture). Longer tutorials will benefit from having an end point where users can continue watching without losing interest; this is where your "how-to" videos come in handy! But no matter how long or short your video is, make sure that there's something happening on screen or at least some sort of movement like panning around frames or zooming in on details so that viewers won't get bored while waiting for something new to happen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Entertainment value</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most important thing to keep in mind when creating videos is entertainment value. If your content is not entertaining, it will be hard for viewers to stay engaged.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To ensure that you have enough entertainment value, try using humor or other techniques that make the viewer feel more involved with what's happening in the video. You can also use relevant topics and keep them fresh by adding new information regularly (for example, every two weeks).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Make sure that each video reflects its purpose as an advertisement for a product or service and if possible, create multiple versions of these types of videos so there's always something new on YouTube!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally: remember consistency! Create a consistent look and feel between all of your videos so viewers know what they should expect from each one; if one type doesn't fit into this mold well enough then consider changing up styles slightly before moving forward with production."</p>

<h2>Authenticity</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Authenticity is the most important thing you can do to keep your viewers interested. Don't try to be someone else; don't try to be something you're not. Just be yourself and people will love it!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Keep it high quality, keep it authentic, and keep it entertaining.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most important aspect of a YouTube video is its quality. This is subjective, so it's not just a question of what you think is good or bad it's also about how others perceive your content. But if you want to keep your audience engaged and interested in what you have to say, then the best way to do that is by making sure that the video itself lives up to their expectations for quality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The audio needs to be clear and understandable; if someone can't hear what's going on because the sound was too low or something else was off with their speakers/headphones/etc., then they'll stop watching before they even get started! And while editing may seem like an insignificant detail when it comes down purely on aesthetics alone (which we'll address later), there are other aspects involved here as well: timing and pacing play major roles in keeping viewers engaged throughout an entire length of time--and these things aren't necessarily easy for anyone but experienced editors who've been doing this kind work long enough already."</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We hope that you can use these tips to become a more successful YouTube creator. The best way to do this is by taking your time and creating content that will keep your audience engaged, which means keeping them entertained and interested throughout the entire video. Happy videography!</p>

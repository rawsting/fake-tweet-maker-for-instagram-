  <p>How to screenshot in Windows PC or Laptop

Screenshots are a great way to share your computer screen with others. They can help you troubleshoot and debug problems on your computer, or simply provide an image of the current state of your desktop. With screenshots, it's easy to share something that you've done in one location (like Slack) so others can see what you were working on at the time—and then easily recall those steps later if they need them!

Windows 10

To take a screenshot in Windows 10, press the Windows key and then the Print Screen button. The screen will flash and you will see a thumbnail of your screenshot in the lower-right corner. You can then open Paint, Word or any other image editor to edit your screenshot.

Windows 8.1, Windows 8 and Windows 7

To take a screenshot in Windows 8.1, Windows 8 or Windows 7:

Press the Windows key and hold down the PrtScn button.

This will launch Snipping Tool which is a simple program that lets you capture images of your screen in one click. You can use it to capture screenshots of specific areas or even parts of your screen if needed.

Windows Vista

To screenshot in Windows Vista, press the Print Screen key and then open Paint. Paste your screenshot into Paint and save it to a folder or file on your computer.

Learn how to capture a screenshot of your computer monitor and save it to your computer, ease start with the keyboard shortcut for your version of Windows.

Press the PrntScrn key.

The screenshot will be saved to your clipboard.

If you want to save it for later use, hold down Alt+PrntScrn keys at once (you can also press them together).

If you use a PC or laptop, you probably know that there are a ton of ways to take screenshots on your device. Windows 10 includes a built-in screenshot tool that lets you take pictures of anything on your screen, whether it's the desktop itself or whatever else is happening in front of it. But if you want more control over how those images look when they're saved as .png files without any editing done by default (like taking an entire webpage out of context), then using one of these third-party apps will be much better suited for your needs than what Microsoft provides natively with its operating system due to their additional features and ways to edit the pictures. Below, you'll find a list of the best screenshot apps for Windows 10 that can help you take high-quality screenshots as well as edit them in various ways so they look even better than they did before.</p>
